### Introduction to Urban Sociology (2025/26)  
*Lecturer, Free University of Berlin, JFK Institute*  

Cities are fundamental sites of modern social life, concentrating both opportunity and inequality, innovation and conflict. Understanding cities requires examining how markets, states, and social movements shape urban space, and how race, class, gender, and immigration intersect in the urban context. 

This seminar examines American cities over the past 150 years through major theoretical traditions and empirical themes. We explore housing markets, racial segregation, immigration, suburbanization, gentrification, policing, gender, finance, education, and urban politics. Throughout, we maintain a comparative lens, juxtaposing American patterns with European experiences.
